# PHP-Vulnerability-Tester
A very simple script that crawls through a list of websites and performs very basic vulnerability tests.

The script works by adding a websites.txt file in the same directory which lists the websites to test vulnerabilities on, one for each newline.
the sites should be in the form of site_name.domain_extension (example.com).

Please do use websites that are compliant in getting their security tested as using this without permission may lead into policy violations.
